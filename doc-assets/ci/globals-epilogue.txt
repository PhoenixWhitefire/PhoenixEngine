## Datatypes

Custom types with functions and properties.

### `Color`
* A Color stored with Red, Green, and Blue components ranging from `0` to `1`

#### Constructors:

##### `Color.new(R: number, G: number, B: number)`
* Constructs a new `Color` with the values provided

#### Properties:
* `R`, `G`, `B`: The Red, Green and Blue components

### `Matrix`
* A 4x4 Matrix

#### Constructors:

##### `Matrix.new()`
* Constructs a new, identity Matrix without any transformations

#### `Matrix.fromTranslation(Position: vector)`
* Constructs a new Matrix at the position of the given vector

##### `Matrix.fromTranslation(X: number, Y: number, Z: number)`
* Constructs a new Matrix at the given coordinates

##### `Matrix.fromEulerAnglesXYZ(X: number, Y: number, Z: number)`
* Constructs a new Matrix with the provided rotation in radians, rotated in the order X, Y, and then Z.

##### `Matrix.lookAt(Eye: vector, Target: vector)`
* Constructs a new Matrix at position `Eye` rotated to face toward `Target`

#### Properties:
* `Position: vector`: The coordinates of the Matrix
* `Forward: vector`: A unit vector representing the Matrix's forward basis 

#### Operators:
* `*`: Multiply two Matrices to transform one by the other

### `GameObject`
* A Game Object

#### Constructors:

##### `GameObject.new(FirstComponent: string)`
* Constructs a new GameObject with the provided `FirstComponent`
