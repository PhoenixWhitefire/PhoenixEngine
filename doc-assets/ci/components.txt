The Engine support an Entity Component System architecture, meaning that `GameObject`s have their own "base" APIs, which can be extended by adding *Components*. These are all listed below.


## `Transform`

### Properties:
* `Transform: Matrix`: The Transformation of the Object from the World
* `Size: Vector3`: The Size of the Object influenced by the Component

## `Script`

* A Luau script

### Properties:
* `SourceFile: string`: The File the Script is executing. Changing this to a valid File immediately reloads the Script if it is a descendant of the `DataModel` (i.e. `game`). To forcefully reload it, `:Reload` should be used

### Functions:
* `Reload() -> (Bool)`: Re-compiles the Source file and runs it from the beginning

## `Animation`

No members defined

## `SpotLight`

* A light which emits in a conical shape

### Properties:
* `Shadows: boolean`: Whether the Light can render shadows
* `LightColor: Color`: The color of the Light
* `Brightness: number`: How bright the Light is
* `Range: number`: How far light is emitted
* `Angle: number`: The Field-of-View (in radians) of light emission

## `PointLight`

* A light source emitting light omnidirectionally from its `Transform`

### Properties:
* `Shadows: boolean`: Whether the Light can render shadows
* `Brightness: number`: How bright the Light is
* `Range: number`: How far light is emitted. **If `>= 0`, the Range is used and attenuation is linear, otherwise the formula `R = 1/D^2`, where `D` is the distance of any point in 3D space having its lighting calculated from the PointLight, is used for real-world attenuation**
* `LightColor: Color`: The color of the Light

## `Sound`

* A sound

### Properties:
* `Volume: number`: The volume at which the sound plays. Must be positive
* `SoundFile: string`: The `.wav` file to be played
* `Speed: number`: The speed at which the sound plays, within the range of 0.01 to 100
* `Position: number`: Number of seconds from beginning of the file
* `FinishedLoading: Bool READONLY`: Whether the Sound has finished loading the `SoundFile`
* `Looped: boolean`: Whether playback should loop once it reaches the end
* `Length: Double READONLY`: The length of the sound in seconds
* `Playing: boolean`: Whether the Sound is currently playing (or requested to play, if `.Playing` is set to `true` by a `Script` before it has finished loading)

## `Camera`

* A 3D camera

### Properties:
* `FieldOfView: number`: The field-of-view. By default, `70`
* `UseSimpleController: boolean`: Whether it is affected by the built-in controller (`W`/`A`/`S`/`D` horizontal movement, `Q`/`E` vertical, Mouse to look around)
* `Transform: Matrix`: Where it is in 3D space

## `Workspace`

* The container used for storing the main parts of a scene (3D objects)
* If this is `Destroy`'d, the application closes

### Properties:
* `SceneCamera: GameObject`: The `Camera` the Player sees the world through. If set to `nil`, a *fallback* is created at the origin.

### Functions:
* `ScreenPointToRay(Array, Double) -> (Vector3)`: Converts the provided X and Y screen coordinates to a world-space vector, with the length provided or `1` by default

## `Model`

* A container

No members defined

## `DataModel`

* The root of the scene


### Functions:
* `Close(Integer) -> ()`: Closes the application

## `DirectionalLight`

* Intended to model a large light source infinitely far away, like the Sun

### Properties:
* `Shadows: boolean`: Whether the Light can render shadows
* `Brightness: number`: How bright the Light is
* `LightColor: Color`: The color of the Light
* `Direction: Vector3`: The direction light is emitted from

## `Mesh`

* A mesh composed of triangles

### Properties:
* `Friction: number`: Fraction of Velocity it should lose per second while in contact with another object while `PhysicsDynamics` is `true`
* `PhysicsCollisions: boolean`: Whether other physics objects can collide with it
* `LinearVelocity: Vector3`: Its velocity
* `Transparency: number`: Its transparency/translucency
* `Tint: Color`: The Color it should be tinted with
* `Asset: string`: The path to the underlying `.hxmesh` file, or a built-in identifier like `!Quad` or `!Cube`
* `RoughnessFactor: number`: Roughness modifier
* `Density: number`: Its density (`Mass = Density * Size`)
* `PhysicsDynamics: boolean`: Whether the Physics Engine should apply forces to it
* `MetallnessFactor: number`: Metallness modifier
* `CollisionFidelity: number`: 0 - `Aabb`: An axis-aligned bounding box. 1 - `AabbStaticSize`: An AABB which keeps the same size as the Object
* `AngularVelocity: Vector3`: Its rotational velocity
* `Material: string`: The name of the `.mtl` in the `resources/materials/` directory it should use
* `FaceCulling: number`: An integer. `0` means no culling, `1` to cull its "back" faces, and `2` to cull its "front" faces
* `CastsShadows: boolean`: Bool

## `ParticleEmitter`

* An emitter of 2D particles

### Properties:
* `Rate: number`: An integer indicating how many particles should be emitted per second (must be above or equal to `0`)
* `ParticlesAreAttached: boolean`: Whether the particles are attached to and move with the emitter
* `Emitting: boolean`: Whether the emitter should emit new particles
* `Lifetime: Vector2`: The X and Y components act as a range of how long any particle can last, in seconds
