Additional modifications to the `CMakeLists.txt`, in case it needs to be re-generated (I used cmake_converter)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET v143)

!! REMEMBER TO PUT THIS *AFTER* THE PROJECT NAME HAS BEEN SET AS "PhoenixEngine" (i.e. after `set(PROJECT_NAME PhoenixEngine)`)

set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY VS_STARTUP_PROJECT PhoenixEngine)
