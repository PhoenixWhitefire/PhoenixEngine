Additional modifications to the `CMakeLists.txt`, in case it needs to be re-generated (I used cmake_converter)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET v143)

Put this at the end
I'm not sure where the actual correct place is, but it's somewhere after it sets PROJECT_NAME

set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY VS_STARTUP_PROJECT PhoenixEngine)
